# Description
The database consists of the multi-spectral values
	of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image,
	and the classification associated with the central pixel
	in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this
	classification, given the multi-spectral values. In
	the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as
	a number.
  
# Problem type
Classification

# Conclusion
The objective of this project was to classify landsat data based on their multi-spectral values. We are using a Random Forest classifier and our prediction accuracy is approximatively about 90%.
